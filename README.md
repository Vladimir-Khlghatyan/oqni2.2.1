This is a real project that aims to create a biological smart leg prosthesis that, by connecting to a human limb, will be able to read human muscle impulses through sensors and control the prosthesis using artificial intelligence in such a way that a person feels as comfortable as possible when walking.

In this project, my task is to write a C++ GUI program using QT framework that can process signals coming from a microcontroller (whose sensors measure human muscle activity) via serial-port, perform some calculations and create a database on the basis of which artificial intelligence can be trained.g.
